# R Script

This folder contains scripts used to process raw data from the Library of Canadian Parliament.

* The R script, `LOP_ElectionsCandidates.R` is used to process **election results** from Parlinfo's [Elections and Candidates](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/ElectionsRidings/Elections) data set into the research-friendly data found in this repository. 

* The R script, `LOP_Ridings.R` is used to process data on federal ridings from Parlinfo's [Ridings](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/ElectionsRidings/Ridings) data set to match the naming conventions of other data found in this repository.

The cleaned data can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Lucas-Czarnecki/Canadian-Federal-Elections/tree/main/data/cleaned).
