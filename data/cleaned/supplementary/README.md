# Supplementary Data

The folder `supplementary` contains multiple files that may be of interest to researchers. Data include supplementary files as well as aggregate data based on the original LOP data set. The following data sets are available in csv and Rds formating:

### `FED_Ridings` 

Presents data from Parlinfo's [Ridings](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/ElectionsRidings/Ridings) data set. The data lists the name, start date, and end date of every federal riding from 1867 to the present.

### `Summary_of_Elections` 

Aggregates various variables at the national-level of analysis for both general and by-elections. The data set records the total number of constituencies in each election, distinguishes between the number of ridings (i.e., constituencies) from the district magnitude (i.e., number of seats) <sup>1</sup>, the number of candidates, the number of political parties <sup>2</sup>, and the total number of valid votes cast in each election. 

### `Summary_of_Ridings` 

Provides supplementary data based on the LOP's original data set. Data are aggregated at the constituency-level of analysis for both general and by-elections. Variables include the total number of candidates, political parties <sup>2</sup>, district magnitude <sup>1</sup>, and valid votes for each riding from 1867 to the present.

 > Note 1: Canadian federal elections before 1966 featured dual-member ridings (i.e., single ridings that elected two representatives). The number of ridings, therefore, is not equivalent to the number of contested seats during these earlier elections. Instead, the number of constituencies is consistently fewer than the number of seats contested.
<br><br>
> Note 2: the number of political parties includes independents and those who ran as "not affiliated". Candidates not affiliated with a political party may choose to identify as either an "independent" or have "no designation of political affiliation" appear on elections-related documents. These are distinct categories according to the Canada Elections Act and are treated as such in the LOP's data. Note also that the number of parties is an **approximation** as historically (up to the 25th Parliament) many candidates' political affiliations are `Unknown`. In some cases, therefore, the recorded number may *underrepresent* the total number of parties that were registered at a given time and riding.
